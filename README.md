# Worldwide-Cities-Prayer-Times
A Python script that scrapes Islamic prayer times from IslamicFinder.org for a specified city and displays them on a Polybar panel. It uses requests and Beautiful Soup libraries for HTTP requests and parsing HTML respectively. The script can be run periodically with a scheduler to keep the prayer times up-to-date.
